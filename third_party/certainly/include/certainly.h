/*
 * certainly.h — Public API for the Certainly TLS library
 *
 * Certainly provides TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 connectivity for classic Mac
 * OS 9 apps. It handles the handshake, record-layer encryption, and
 * certificate verification on top of Open Transport. Callers supply
 * plaintext (HTTP requests, etc.); Certainly handles the crypto.
 *
 * Usage pattern:
 *
 *   MacTLS_Init();
 *   ctx = MacTLS_Create("api.example.com", 443);
 *
 *   // In your event loop:
 *   while (running) {
 *       WaitNextEvent(everyEvent, &event, 1, NULL);
 *       HandleEvent(&event);
 *
 *       state = MacTLS_Pump(ctx);
 *       if (state == kMacTLS_Connected) {
 *           MacTLS_Write(ctx, request, strlen(request));
 *           n = MacTLS_Read(ctx, buf, sizeof(buf));
 *       }
 *   }
 *
 *   MacTLS_Close(ctx);
 *   MacTLS_Shutdown();
