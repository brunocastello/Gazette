/*
 * entropy.c — Mac OS 9 entropy gathering
 *
 * HOW THIS WORKS:
 *
 * We maintain a 256-byte "pool" that accumulates entropy. Each
 * time we gather entropy, we:
 *   1. Read values from multiple OS sources (timers, mouse, etc.)
 *   2. XOR each source's bytes into the pool at a rotating offset
 *   3. When it's time to seed BearSSL, inject the entire pool
 *
 * BearSSL's HMAC_DRBG (inside the SSL engine) does the heavy
 * lifting of turning our messy entropy into cryptographic-quality
 * random bytes. HMAC_DRBG is standardized (NIST SP 800-90A) and
 * designed to handle imperfect entropy inputs — it mixes everything
 * together using HMAC-SHA256.
 *
 * We inject entropy multiple times (at init, per-connection) so
 * the pool improves over time as more mouse movements and timing
 * variations accumulate.

 *
 * GetMouse() — returns cursor position.
 *   Quality: MEDIUM. Genuinely unpredictable if the user is moving
 *   the mouse. Even slight jitter contributes real entropy.
 *
 * OTGetTimeStamp() — OT's internal high-resolution timer.
 *   Quality: MEDIUM. Includes network interrupt timing jitter.
 *
 * Stack contents — read some bytes from our own stack.
