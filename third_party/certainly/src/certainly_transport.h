 * Certainly needs very little from a network stack: open a connection, pump
 * it, push bytes, pull bytes, close it. This header is that interface and
 * names no operating system, so one build of the TLS code serves any host
 * that can satisfy it. transport_ot.c is the Open Transport implementation
 * for Mac OS 9; transport_win32.c is the Winsock one.
 *
 * Every function is non-blocking. The caller drives progress by calling
 * ct_transport_pump() from its event loop.

/*
 * A connection handle owned by whoever opened it, for the adopt path.
 *
 * Open Transport hands out a pointer; Winsock hands out an integer, and
 * INVALID_SOCKET is all ones rather than zero. Neither fits the other, so the
 * type is per-platform and callers on each side use their own.
 *
 * This block comes before <stdbool.h> deliberately. MacTypes.h declares true
 * and false as enumerators, so a stdbool that got in first turns that
 * declaration into "enum { 0 = 0, 1 = 1 }" and the Universal Interfaces stop
 * compiling. The header this replaced had the same ordering for the same
 * reason; it just did not say so.
