/*
 * transport_ot.c — the Open Transport implementation of certainly_transport.h
 *
 * HOW OT ASYNC WORKS:
 *
 * When we create an endpoint, we register a "notifier" — a callback
 * function that OT calls when events happen. The notifier runs at
 * INTERRUPT TIME, meaning:
 *   - It can't allocate memory (NewPtr)
 *   - It can't call most Toolbox functions
 *   - It can't move memory (no handle dereferencing)
 *   - It CAN set flags and copy small amounts of data
 *
 * So our notifier just sets boolean flags ("hey, data arrived!").
 * Then ct_transport_pump(), which runs at normal application time,
 * checks those flags and does the actual work. This two-phase
 * pattern (notifier sets flags → pump reads flags) is the standard
 * way to do async OT programming.
